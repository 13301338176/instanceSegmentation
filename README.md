![](./data/custom_background.gif)

This repo goes along with this [Medium Blog Post](). It contains code files for performing instance segmentation on live video capture devices.

It uses cv2 to start a video capture and renders the output which is either *blurred* or *background substituted*. More details about the implementation could be found in the medium blog post mentioned above.
